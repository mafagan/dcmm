Description of folders:
    src:
        1. dcmm:
            the source code of `dcmm`
        2. mosquitto-1.2.3-with-dcmm:
            the source code of `mosquitto`, which use `dcmm` to send data
        3. makefile:
            used for compiling and installation

    lib:
        used for placing the api files after calling `make` in the `src` folder

    example:    client's example codes, including:
        1. simple_pub_example.c:
            a simple example, which use `libmosquittodcmm.so` to publish to server
        2. pub_client.c:
            the original example of publish in `mosquitto-1.2.3`,
            but using `libmosquittodcmm.so` instead of `libmosquitto.so`
        3. sub_client.c:
            the original example of subscribe in `mosquitto-1.2.3`,
            but using `libmosquittodcmm.so` instead of `libmosquitto.so`
        4. makefile:
            used for compiling *.c in `example` folder
        5. mosquitto_dcmm.h:
            the api's header file, it's a copy of header file in lib/include

Usage:
    1. compile
        make -C src    //after compiling, we will copy the
                       //api files into the `lib` folder
    2. installation
        sudo make -C src install    //this operation will copy
                                    //the `header` files into /usr/include,
                                    //the `*.so` into /usr/lib/,
                                    //`dcmm` and `mosquitto`(mqtt's server side
                                    //program) into /usr/bin , u can use
                                    //`make uninstall` to delete them
    3. api usage for client
        there're some examples in the `example` folder, if u want to know more
        details of the api, u can read the function description in the
        header files, `mosquitto_dcmm.h`, normally, they will place
        at lib/include aftering compiling

Thanks!
